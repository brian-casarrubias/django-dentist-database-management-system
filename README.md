in this project I created a dentist website, that handles user registration, and it only allows you to register if you also provide a "SECRET CODE' that I made, which in my case is just 321. In this project, you have a dashboard, where you can see how many patients, dentist, and appointments you have. When you click on one of them you are brought to the list page where you can see every single one of what ever you clicked. In this project I made use of djangos ListView, detail view, and delete view, aswell as django filters to be able to search for a specific patient, just in case the list gets too long!
